A PROJECT REPORT ON  “PREDICTION OF INDIAN TOURISTER’S USING TIME SERIES  ANALYSIS, ARIMA MODEL and AIC”

**Defination**
 Time series analysis is the study of a sequence of data points ordered in time. This data can be used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships over time. Examples: Weather records, economic indicators and patient health evolution metrics.

 
 **OBJECTIVE**
The objectives of time series analysis include understanding how variables change over time, identifying the factors that influence these changes, and predicting future values of the time series variable. Where time is a independent variable and other variable’s are depend on time .

 
 **PREDICTION OF TOURIST IN INDIA**
INDIA country becomes one of the top travel destinations in recent years. Understanding the characteristics of the time series representing international visits to the country provides valuable insights for business. In this exercise, the main interest ware seasonality pattern, trend, and variance. The outcome is used in budgeting and revenue planning for one of the local hotels.


Using Linear Regression ARIMA and AIC(al, I used a simple yet helpful time series decomposition and a straightforward approach to forecasting. There are other methods, but the choice wasn’t accidental. The end-user needed a solution that could be easy to understand. Project took place after covid-19 pandemic. The data comes from the  Ministry of Tourism INDIA, https://tourism.gov.in/.


Time series analysis of Indian tourist trends holds significant potential for understanding patterns, forecasting arrivals, policy formulation, and evaluating marketing strategies. By leveraging historical data and incorporating external factors, stakeholders can make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and promote sustainable tourism growth. Overcoming challenges related to data availability, quality, and modeling complexity is essential to ensure accurate predictions and meaningful insights. Time series analysis enables the tourism industry to adapt to changing trends.
